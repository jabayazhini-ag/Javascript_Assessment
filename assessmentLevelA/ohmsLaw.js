// Ohm's Law statement
console.log("Statement: Ohm's law states that the voltage across a conductor is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, provided all physical conditions and temperature, remain constant.");

// Ohm's Law formula
console.log("Formula: V = I*R");

// Explanation of the variables
console.log("  where:");
console.log("  V is the voltage across the conductor.");
console.log("  I is the current flowing through the conductor.");
console.log("  R is the resistance provided by the conductor to the flow of current.");

// Example calculation using Ohm's Law
console.log("Example: If the resistance of an electric iron is 50 Î© and a current of 3.2 A flows through the resistance, the voltage between two points is as follows:");

// Given values
const current = 3.2;       // in Amperes
const resistance = 50;     // in Ohms

// Calculate voltage using Ohm's Law
const voltage = current * resistance;
console.log("Voltage (V) = " + voltage + " Volts");
